# Traffic Accident Analysis
## Overview
This project involves analyzing traffic accident data to uncover patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The goal is to understand the key factors contributing to traffic accidents and visualize these insights to aid in traffic safety improvements.
## Project Components
*Data Exploration*: Examination of the dataset to identify key features and trends.
*Data Cleaning*: Handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
*Analysis & Visualization*: Creating visualizations to highlight important patterns and insights.
*Insights*: Key findings from the analysis.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a traffic accident dataset, which includes features such as:
- Time of accident
- Day of the week
- Vehicle and driver details
- Road and weather conditions
- Number of vehicles and casualties involved
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Key Findings
- *Time of Day:* Accidents peak around 5 PM, coinciding with the evening rush hour.
- *Casualties:* Most accidents involve only one casualty.
- *Vehicles Involved:* The majority of accidents involve two vehicles.
- *Road Conditions:* Most accidents occur on dry roads, suggesting other factors may play significant roles.
